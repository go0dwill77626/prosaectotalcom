                <p>Whether Industries serves in Oil and Gas, Water Solution, pharmaceutical or food processing, you will
                    likely need a skid system for your industry. Skid systems continue to grow in popularity and refer
                    to a process system which contains process equipment, piping components, instruments and valves
                    within a steel frame. Such individual skids can be combined to create larger process systems or
                    entire portable plants.
